      summary: Forward Geocoding
      description: >-
        The Search API allows converting addresses, such as a street address,
        into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). These coordinates
        can serve various use-cases, from placing markers on a map to helping
        algorithms determine nearby bus stops. This process is also known as
        Forward Geocoding.

          description: >-
            Sometimes you have several objects in OSM identifying the same place
            or object in reality. The simplest case is a street being split in
            many different OSM ways due to different characteristics. Nominatim
            will attempt to detect such duplicates and only return one match;
            this is controlled by the dedupe parameter which defaults to 1.
            Since the limit is, for reasons of efficiency, enforced before and
            not after de-duplicating, it is possible that de-duplicating leaves
            you with less results than requested.
