      summary: Forward Geocoding
      description: >-
        The Search API allows converting addresses, such as a street address,
        into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). These coordinates
        can serve various use-cases, from placing markers on a map to helping
        algorithms determine nearby bus stops. This process is also known as
        Forward Geocoding.

            Sometimes you have several objects in OSM identifying the same place
            or object in reality. The simplest case is a street being split in
            many different OSM ways due to different characteristics. Nominatim
            will attempt to detect such duplicates and only return one match;
            this is controlled by the dedupe parameter which defaults to 1.
            Since the limit is, for reasons of efficiency, enforced before and
            not after de-duplicating, it is possible that de-duplicating leaves
            you with less results than requested.

        The Autocomplete API is a variant of the Search API that returns place predictions in response to an HTTP request. 
        The request specifies a textual search string and optional geographic bounds. 
        The service can be used to provide autocomplete functionality for text-based geographic searches, by returning places such as businesses, addresses and points of interest as a user types.
        The Autocomplete API can match on full words as well as substrings. Applications can therefore send queries as the user types, to provide on-the-fly place predictions.

        Matching API matches or snaps given GPS points to the road network in the most plausible way. 
        Please note the request might result multiple sub-traces. 
        Large jumps in the timestamps (> 60s) or improbable transitions lead to trace splits if a complete matching could not be found.
        The algorithm might not be able to match all points. Outliers are removed if they can not be matched successfully.
